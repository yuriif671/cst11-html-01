            I want to tell an old story about Napi. Napi chose a large area of land, East of the Rockies. He put on there, all the different animals that walk on mother Earth, the water animals, the ones that fly.  <img class="napi" src="images/napi.jpg" alt=""> He built the rivers and landmarks in this area and they were all named in Blackfoot. When He came to build, put the buffalo on Mother Earth, all the rest would kill another, eat one another. “But the buffalo,” He said to himself, “I should put on Mother Earth, people similar to me, so they can make use of the buffalo.” <img class="blackfoot" src="images/blackfoot.jpg" alt="">
